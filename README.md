# RubyCalculator



My first attempt at building something with the Ruby language, I used the guide which was provided by Udemy as an online learning portal to work through it.
I struggled initially with the user_prompt input but managed to overcome and generate a working calculator.

I would like to expand on this using other mathetical equations and create a virtual math quiz with a series of questions that you'd need to answer correctly to move on to the next.
